# Resume

We are going to set up a server so you can have a **multimedia center** in your home and you can also **make your backups** of important stuff in the same place!
Multimedia:

- Movies
- TV
- Books

# Recommended

- Set this up on a laptop or cpu that you don't use and can be on all day.
- Install Debian without GUI (GNOME), this will consume less resources and you won't need it.
- For the system you only need 30gb, the rest will be for your files.
- Connect the laptop/pc via ethernet, wifi can get slow or slow down your wifi for all other uses.
- Do not open ports, use WireGuard.
- Seed the files at least 1.0 ratio.

# Requirements

- [debian/debian based distro](https://brockar.github.io/easy-download-debian/)
- [your user with sudo](https://gcore.com/learning/how-to-add-user-to-sudoers-in-debian/)
- git and curl (`sudo apt install git curl`)
- [docker and docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Static ip](#static-ip)

## Install the rest of apps

Download this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsilverdev/docker-media-server.git
```

Make the folders you need.
My directory organization is as follows:

```text
/home/user/
├── backup
├── media-server
|   ├── jackett
|   ├── jellyfin
|   ├── lazylibrarian
|   ├── radarr
|   └── sonarr
└── media-content
    └── media
    |   ├── movies
    |   ├── books
    |   └── tv
    └── downloads
```

Modify the docker compose with your paths, on each `volumes:` on each container.

---

Here we have all ready, now just

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


## Static ip

```bash
ip a
```

Look for enXXX: inet , for example eno1 o enp1s0: `192.168.100.X`.

Now configure to static your ip

```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

from

```bash
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto enp1s0
iface enp1s0 inet dhcp
```

to

```bash
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

#The primary network interface
auto enp1s0
iface enp1s0 inet static
  address 192.168.100.100 # Select your ip, i recommend .100, u can select from 2 to 255 but if is low, can fails.
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.100.1 # The same as your initial ip but with an 1 at the least
```

# Config to auto download.

## General

Configure **Jackett** (localhost:9117) to obtain the indexers (from where the torrents are obtained).
Add some (1337x, EZTV for example) and save them.

From this page we are going to grab the Torznab Feed and the KEY API for Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr.

Configure **qBitorrent** to download at the speeds you want at the times you want.
(localhost:8080)

Configuration > Speed > Alternative speed limits.
Select the speeds.
Check `Schedule the use of alternative rate limits` and select the schedules.
Save it.

## Sonarr / (TV/Series)

(localhost:8989)
Settings > Indexers.
Add the indexers from Jackett.
Just select TVs, not movies.

You can also configure the rest as you wish.

## Radarr / (Movies)

(localhost:7878/)
Do the same as in Sonar but with series.

## Download

Now you just have to add the series (Sonarr) you want to watch and the movies (Radarr) or music (Lidarr).

You can view the status of downloads in the applications themselves or in qBittorrent.

## Enjoy your content (and seed it!).

at http://localhost:8097 or on your TV / Mobile.

# How to use

## Media

Search for the content you want to download in its respective application.
Wait for it to download.
Watch it on Jellyfin.

`apt install vbetool`
to screen off
